Rock Paper Scissors Game 

This is my rock, paper, scissors guided inquiry project for Road To Hire. 
I am currently a part of cohort 18 for Road To Hire as an apprentice.
This project only contains one page.

My project has a Minnie Mouse/ bow theme throughout the entire layout to add some fun and eye attracting designs. 

My header contains: the name of my game along with a Minnie Mouse image.

You are able to input 3 options: rock, paper, and scissors in the input box; any other submission will give an alert to the user and clear the input box for reentry.
With animation used in js it shakes the 3 images that are your options to resemble the action of the actual rock, paper, scissors game. It then loads the image of what the user chose and what the computer chose.
Below this it will pop up the text of the results whether: you win, you lose, or it was a tie.

There is an image that will show up until the result image generate so that the space is not just empty

This page also contains a scoreboard the tracks your wins, losses, and ties. I will add them up everytime you play unless you hit the reset score button which is another feature I addede and it functionality uses js.

My footer contains the following message "This project is for educational purposes only. I do not own the right to any Disney characters or images used. All trademarks and copyrights belong to their respective owners" to verify the images are not copyrighted.


I used html,css, and js for the layout and funcionality of my page.

This page includes images that correlate with my Minnie Mouse theme.
